      <h2>Meaning of Pollution</h2>
      <p>
       An alteration of air quality is characterized by measurable changes in the chemical, biological, or physical pollutants present in the air.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="causes">
      <h2>Causes of Pollution</h2>
      <h3>Man Made Sources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Road transportation is one of the main causes of air pollution in cities. Exhaust smoke from motor vehicles can release harmful gases and soot particles which is coated with toxic subtances into the surrounding air. In particular, diesel vehicles are very dangerous because they produce these pollutants in high concentrations. Air pollution also happens due tiny pieces of metal and rubber that comes off the vehicles's brakes and tires, as well as dust which had been collected from the surface of the road. Thes particles remain airborne due to the movement of vehicle and traffic.</li>
        <li>Most of the electricity that we use for our appliances at home comes from power station that generates energy by burning fossil fuel. These processes can release harmful air pollutants into our atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Indusrial processes such as the manufacturing of cement, iron, steel, glass and paper can cause air pollution. Areas that have more industrial industrial zones and factories tend to have higher levels of air pollutions.</li>
        <li>Urban areas, especially large cities, have a high level of air pollution compared to most rural areas due to the high population density, transportation and industries. For example, megacities like Tokyo, Shangai and Dehli face serious air pollution problems. Pollution in these areas area often visible as a thick blanket of grey haze staying suspended in the atmosphere over the cities. Rural areas are usually more open and windy, which allows air pollution to fade more easily, resulting in a better air quality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Natural Causes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Temperature, rain, and wind can influence air pollution. For example, wet and windy conditions can reduce the ammount of air pollution in certain areas by cleaning it from the air or moving it somewhere else. Meanwhile, dry and stagnant conditions can cause limited airflow, which traps the air pollution. This means that the air pollution can accumulatr in a landlocked areas like cities in mountainous regions.</li>
        <li>Desert dust comes from the surface of dray or semi-dry regions around the world, such as the Sahara Desert, Eastern Australia storms can be carried thousands of kilometers by the wind and may mix with human-made air pollution. This means that desert dust also causes air pollution in other areas which are from the desert.</li>
        <li>Volcanic eruptions will release volcanic ash into the air. The wind then will carry the ash thosands of kilometers from the volcano itself. For example, in 2010, the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland erupted. An estimation of 50% of the volcanic ash was carried across Europe and the North Atlantic. Air traffic in these areas were stopped for several days after the eruption.</li>
        <li>Forest fires happens all over the world and contribute significantly to serious air pollution problems. These fires are becoming more common and more severe due to changes in temperature and rainfan globally, which lead to more longer fire seasons and larger areas being burned. Wildfire smoke of consits of a mixture of substances such as fine particles (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NOa) and carbon monoxide, which are produced from the burning of various materials like trees, dry leaves, trash, which often comes from residential homes. Forest fires usually happens in the state of California, America. The dry conditions there make it easier for fires to begin, wheter due to natural events like lightning strikes or human activities such as campfires. The movement of the wind can cause the smoke from the fire to spread across even futher and pollutes the surrounding air of cities and towns</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="Effects">
      <h2>Effects of pollution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Air pollution can affect our health in various ways, such as irritation of the nose, eyes, or throat, causing coughing, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, reduced lung function, or asthma attacks. Some individuals are more at risk of being affected by air pollution than others.</li>
        <li>Air pollution can also have harmful effects on the environment, such as the phenomenon of acid rain, reduced soil fertility, damage to forests and crops, decreased visibility, damage to buildings, and climate change.</li>
